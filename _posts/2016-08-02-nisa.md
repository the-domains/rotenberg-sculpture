_"My eyes were compelled to wander to the left corner of the room. The culprit was this exquisite sculpture of a dancer. Each time I looked at it, I tried to pinpoint as to why I was looking at it again and again. Maybe because it exuded joy - no, it was its effortless grace - no, it had to be its quiet pride - could it be its simplicity - or was it its motion? In short, I just want to say, thank you for the pleasure." ~N.K._
