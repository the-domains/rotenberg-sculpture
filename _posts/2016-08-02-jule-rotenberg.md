  My interest has always been to capture the essence of my subject and allow the
  viewer to find a spiritual and emotional connection with it. I mean to
  contradict the apparent notion that a form made from bronze should be static.
  For me, dance best conveys this and is my inspiration. Since the beginning,
  this intention has translated into less detail and an avoidance of
  illustrative exactness. It allowed for revealing traces of the modeling
  process and the natural textures of the materials. It encouraged freedom to
  exaggerate anatomy and stretch apparent reality. I am always drawn to the
  beauty and power of the human form and willing to move beyond its limitations
  to express the spirit within.
