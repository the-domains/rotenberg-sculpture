BIRDMAN NO. 1

Perched

When the Dance Theatre of Harlem came to town and performed Stravinsky's "Firebird" I went to see it. There on stage was an exquisite illusion - a beautifully dark, lean woman, feathered in red and orange - wild and tempestuous and fierce. She never moved from the one spot, but I believed she could fly.
