  My interest has always been to capture the essence of my subject and allow the
  viewer to find a spiritual and emotional connection with it. I mean to
  contradict the apparent notion that a form made from bronze should be static.
  For me, dance best conveys this and is my inspiration. Since the beginning,
  this intention has translated into less detail and an avoidance of
  illustrative exactness. It allows for revealing traces of the modeling process
  and the natural textures of the materials. It encourages freedom to exaggerate
  anatomy and stretch apparent reality. I am always drawn to the beauty and
  power of the human form and willing to move beyond its limitations to express
  the spirit within.
