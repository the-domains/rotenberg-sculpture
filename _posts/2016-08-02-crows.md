CROWS

Crows are black birds known for their intelligence and adaptability, and for their loud, harsh "caw." They hang out in groups called murders. They'll eat anything including trash. Their tails don't come to a point like a ravens but are squarish.

Crows are extremely intelligent birds. They are known for their problem-solving skills and amazing communication skills. For example, when a crow encounters a mean human, it will teach other crows how to identify the human.

Crows don't forget a face.
