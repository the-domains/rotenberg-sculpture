CROWS

Crows are black birds known for their intelligence and adaptability, and for their loud, harsh "caw." They hang out in groups called murders. They'll eat anything including trash. They never don't forget a face. And if they ever encounter a mean human being, they will tell the others in the murder.

She is offered in a limited edition of nine.

2-9 of 9 available.
